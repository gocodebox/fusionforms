== Description ==

The FusionForms plugin is for Infusionsoft users who are tired of the headache that occurs when trying to embed Infusionsoft webforms on their WordPress website.

For a in-depth overview of the plugin check out [http://fusionforms.co](http://fusionforms.co)

With FusionForms embedding Infusionsoft Webforms is simple. All you have to do is connect your Infusionsoft API to the plugin in the setting. Once your Infusionsoft app is connected, FusionForms will pull form data into its easy-to-use shortcode generator.

Using the shortcode generator you simple select the form in your application, the width that you’d like to have for the form, the alignment and where the label should site.

Hit the button.

BOOM - perfectly styled Infusionsoft Webforms.

Now not all WordPress themes are created equal and if your form isn’t looking perfect you can always adjust the CSS in the setting to make it beautiful.

If you need help with this please [contact us](http://gocodebox.com/fusionforms) and we’d be happy to help you stylize your forms.
